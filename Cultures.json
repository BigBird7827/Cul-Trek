      "Klingon culture treats honor as a public measure of worth: courage under pressure, truth spoken plainly, and a life judged by deeds and accountability. Reputation is shared—an individual’s actions reflect on family and House—so respect is earned through competence, loyalty kept under stress, and the willingness to accept consequences rather than evade them. Even conflict is expected to have rules: a challenge should be direct, the stakes understood, and the outcome faced without excuses.",
      "Power and status are shaped by the Great Houses and the institutions of the Empire, including the Klingon High Council and its Chancellor. Tradition is binding in both politics and law, and “honor” carries practical force: it can elevate a House through service and leadership, or diminish standing through disgrace that stains a family name for generations. Because Houses compete for influence, oaths, alliances, and public conduct become political currency, and questions of legitimacy are often argued through lineage, ritual precedent, and demonstrations of strength.",
      "Klingons preserve identity through ceremony, poetry, and performance alongside warfare. Legendary figures such as Kahless the Unforgettable are invoked as touchstones for legitimacy and conduct, and rites around adulthood and marriage present commitment as something proven through endurance and shared hardship. Belief about the honored dead reaching Sto-vo-kor gives the culture a long horizon: how one lives is treated as inseparable from how one will be remembered, sung about, and judged.",
      "Klingon society places heavy weight on family reputation, ancestry, and duty to one’s House. Status is negotiated in the open: skill, courage, and reliability in crisis matter, and insults that touch a family name can escalate into formal challenges rather than private arguments. The Great Houses provide identity and leverage, and their rivalries can shape careers, alliances, and legal outcomes; the High Council turns tradition into governance, linking personal conduct to public standing. Because honor is communal, Klingons may accept personal sacrifice to protect a House’s future, and disgrace can be socially devastating. At the same time, everyday life includes mentorship, competitive fellowship, story, song, and the repeated testing of character in small ways—keeping one’s word, paying debts, honoring oaths, and showing composure when provoked.",
      "Klingon–Federation relations shift across eras from hostility to peace and cooperation, with major treaties such as the Khitomer Accords forming a foundation for reconciliation. Even during alliance periods, internal Klingon politics and differing assumptions about honor can strain cooperation: Klingons often prize decisive action and personal accountability, while Starfleet may emphasize procedure, diplomacy, and restraint. Cultural misunderstanding is common—what Starfleet reads as reckless aggression may be, to Klingons, an honest willingness to stand and be counted—yet trusted personal bonds between officers and shared defense against common threats repeatedly pull the relationship back toward partnership.",

        "Name": "Klingon tea ceremony",
        "Description": "A ritual test of courage in which two participants drink tea brewed from a poisonous plant while reciting poetry to one another. The ceremony is conducted face-to-face, and composure is part of the trial: the point is not to pretend the danger is absent, but to master fear without losing dignity. It frames shared risk as a form of respect and connection—bravery is proven together, not alone. The use of poetry also signals that Klingon identity includes art and eloquence; a person can be fierce and still be expected to speak well, remember tradition, and honor the moment with words."

        "Name": "Rite of Ascension (Age of Inclusion)",
        "Description": "A coming-of-age rite performed when a child reaches the Age of Inclusion, in which the youth lights a kor'tova candle to symbolize the fire burning in a warrior’s heart and publicly declares the intention to become a warrior. The act is simple, but it is witnessed and remembered: it is meant to mark a turning point from childhood to responsibility. The rite makes identity communal. Becoming a “true” Klingon warrior is not just personal self-image; it is a pledge made in front of others, tying the youth to House expectations and to an inherited standard. The emphasis on public declaration also shows how Klingon honor is built through visible commitments and follow-through."

House expectations can loom over the event, and the ritual can require the couple to demonstrate unity under pressure rather than romance in public. Marriage is framed as duty, lineage, and reputation as much as affection. The ceremony asserts that commitment is proven through endurance and clarity of intent—two people are binding themselves in a way that reflects on their families and may affect House standing. When a Klingon wedding goes poorly, it is not merely awkward; it can be read as a sign that the union lacks the discipline and strength the culture expects."

Canon examples include gagh (a well-known dish of serpent worms), racht, heart of targ, and rokeg blood pie, along with other referenced foods such as bregit lung and pipius claw; the emphasis on freshness and texture can challenge outsiders’ expectations, and Klingons may treat willingness to partake as a sign of comfort with their ways. Drinks carry cultural meaning in celebration and camaraderie: bloodwine is strongly associated with Klingon gatherings and is traditionally served warm, and warnog is a familiar point of reference as Klingon beer. Sharing food and drink often helps establish credibility—participation can be taken as respect, while refusal may be read as discomfort depending on context."

      "Vulcan culture is built around logic as a disciplined practice adopted after an earlier violent past and associated with the teachings of Surak. Emotional control is treated as a lifelong responsibility supported by meditation, study, and social norms that favor restraint, careful speech, and deliberate action. Reason is not portrayed as instinctive; it is trained and maintained through habit, and a Vulcan is expected to manage impulses rather than be ruled by them.",
      "Vulcans acknowledge emotion rather than deny it, but they treat unmanaged emotion as harmful to self and society. Intellectual rigor, ethical consistency, and non-imposition are prized, and the philosophy of Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations (IDIC) is often used as shorthand for valuing difference without abandoning principle. This produces a culture that respects competence and evidence, but also expects individuals to take responsibility for their own self-control.",
      "Privacy is a defining norm. Deeply personal matters—bonding, telepathic intimacy, and family commitments—are handled discreetly, with trust signaled through specific rituals and carefully bounded forms of closeness. The outward reserve is often misread as coldness, but it is frequently intended as respect and restraint: limiting one’s emotional impact on others and keeping intimate life protected rather than performed.",
      "Education and self-mastery are central to Vulcan daily life. Training in mental disciplines begins early, and many Vulcans study with teachers or masters to refine meditation, focus, and emotional regulation; public conduct tends to be formal and measured, and disagreements are often framed as questions of logic and evidence rather than displays of feeling. Family life can reflect tradition and obligation: canon depicts arranged engagements and long-standing commitments, and personal choices are weighed against duty, reputation, and cultural continuity. Telepathic practices carry special weight because of their intimacy—consent and discretion are treated as essential—and the mind meld is depicted as a serious act rather than casual contact, sometimes even surrounded by stigma in certain eras. Institutions of learning and service are prestigious, and competence is often treated as an ethical obligation to apply reason responsibly.",
      "Vulcans have long-standing ties to Starfleet and the Federation, frequently contributing scientific expertise, diplomatic caution, and a preference for measured escalation. Cultural differences can create friction—especially around emotional expression, improvisation, and risk tolerance—but shared principles and sustained cooperation usually reinforce the partnership. Vulcans may be perceived as judgmental when attempting to prevent harm through caution, while Vulcans may perceive Starfleet as reckless when it values speed over deliberation; the relationship works best when both sides recognize that the same ethical goal—reducing harm—can produce different instincts about how to act.",

The familiar split-finger salute and associated saying function as a courteous, socially acceptable expression of goodwill that does not require emotional display.

It is treated as both a biological imperative and a social responsibility, with strong expectations of discretion and cultural structure around how it is addressed. Pon farr highlights the tension between powerful biological drives and a culture built on discipline.

Kolinahr represents an idealized endpoint of Vulcan self-mastery and the belief that logic requires continual practice.

That flexibility becomes a cultural asset in diplomacy, where Humans often act as mediators between species with rigid traditions or long-standing grudges.",

    "Profile": [
      "Ferengi culture is built around commerce as both identity and moral language: profit is treated as virtue, negotiation as social skill, and business as the place where intelligence, courage, and status are proven. The Rules of Acquisition function like a shared canon of sayings and principles—quoted, debated, and used to justify decisions—so even personal relationships can get framed as deals, investments, or liabilities.",
      "Government and business are tightly braided. The Ferengi Alliance is led by the Grand Nagus, and commercial life is policed through trade by-laws and regulators, most visibly the Ferengi Commerce Authority (FCA). In practice, this means “free enterprise” still has rules: licenses can be granted or revoked, contracts enforced, and penalties imposed when someone breaks the system that keeps profit flowing.",
      "Social life is transactional but not emotionless. Family and reputation matter, yet they are often measured in economic terms—inheritance, obligations, and the expected return on loyalty. Canon shows constant attention to leverage: who owes whom, what information is worth, and what a concession signals about strength or desperation.",
      "Deep Space Nine, in particular, treats Ferengi society as something that can argue with itself. Episodes centered on Quark’s family and Ferenginar show how official rules collide with practical reality—especially around gender restrictions, corruption, and the hidden costs of exploitation—while still keeping the culture’s core premise intact: most problems are assumed to be solvable through the logic of profit, until lived consequences force a reckoning."

        "Name": "Rules-of-Acquisition thinking",
        "Description": "The Rules of Acquisition are treated as guiding precepts for deals and life decisions, frequently quoted as shorthand for how a “proper” Ferengi should think about opportunity, risk, family, and reputation."
      },
      {
        "Name": "Contract-first social norms",
        "Description": "Promises, favors, and even friendships are often expressed as obligations and terms; people keep score, expect repayment, and view generosity as either strategy, weakness, or an investment."

      {
        "Name": "Regulation and enforcement",
        "Description": "The FCA oversees business practice under Ferengi trade by-laws, with liquidators empowered to investigate, levy penalties, and strip a Ferengi of the right to conduct business when they violate the system."
      },
      {
        "Name": "Bargaining ritual",
        "Description": "Haggling is not just tolerated but expected; opening offers are performative, concessions signal strength or desperation, and the negotiation itself is a test of competence."

    "FoodAndDrink": [
      "Tube grubs are a Ferengi delicacy, commonly eaten live (though they can also be prepared in other ways), and they show up repeatedly as a cultural marker rather than a novelty gag.",
      "Slug-o-Cola is a Ferengi soft drink known for its odd composition—described as containing live algae—and it’s used on screen as a quick shorthand for Ferengi mass-market commerce and taste."

    "Misconceptions": "Ferengi are often dismissed as a one-note culture of greed and bad faith. Canon—especially in DS9—shows a society with a codified legal and social framework around commerce, where profit is treated as ethics, regulation exists to protect the system, and individuals can be both ruthless and sincerely loyal depending on what they believe they owe.",
    "DoAndDont": {
      "Do": "Assume negotiation is normal and come prepared with clear terms, limits, and a sense of what you’re willing to trade. Treat business competence as respect, and remember that reputation travels quickly through networks of favors and contracts.",
      "Dont": "Don’t open by moralizing about profit as if it’s self-evidently shameful, and don’t rely on vague promises when specific terms are expected. Avoid being casually generous in ways that create obligations you don’t intend to pay."
    },
    "Trivia": "By the 22nd century canon references 173 Rules of Acquisition, while 24th-century Ferengi commonly cite 285—suggesting the “sacred” rulebook is continuously expanded over time."
