    "Overview": [
      "Klingon culture centers on honor as a public measure of worth: courage under pressure, directness in conflict, and a life judged by deeds rather than intentions. Reputation matters because it is shared\u2014individual actions reflect on one\u2019s family and House, and respect is often earned through competence, candor, and the willingness to face risk.",
      "Social and political life is shaped by the Great Houses and the institutions of the Empire, including the Klingon High Council and its Chancellor. Tradition is treated as binding, and \u201chonor\u201d has legal weight: standing can be elevated by service and loyalty, or damaged through disgrace that affects families across generations.",
      "Klingons also preserve identity through ceremony, poetry, and performance as much as through warfare. Legendary figures such as Kahless the Unforgettable are invoked to frame values and legitimacy, while rituals around adulthood, courtship, and marriage reinforce the idea that commitment is proven through endurance, restraint, and shared hardship."

    "EverydayLife": {
      "FamilyAndSociety": "Klingon society places heavy weight on family reputation, ancestry, and duty to one\u2019s House. Status is openly negotiated through displays of competence and courage, and insults or slights can become formal matters rather than private disagreements. The Great Houses provide identity and political leverage, and their rivalries can shape careers, alliances, and legal outcomes. Institutions such as the High Council codify tradition into governance, linking personal honor to public standing. Disgrace can be socially and legally consequential, with penalties that can publicly reduce status and stain a family name across generations. Alongside politics, Klingons preserve identity through ceremony, story, and song, treating cultural continuity as a duty owed to one\u2019s ancestors and House.",
      "FoodAndDrink": "Klingon cuisine is known for intense flavors and for dishes that can be challenging to outsiders. Canon examples include gagh (a delicacy made from serpent worms, often eaten live but also served prepared), racht (live worms resembling a larger version of gagh), heart of targ, and dishes such as rokeg blood pie. Among beverages, bloodwine is widely associated with Klingon celebration and is typically served warm, and warnog is a traditional clear Klingon beer."
