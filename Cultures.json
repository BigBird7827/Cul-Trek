Status is public and political: honor can be earned, challenged, defended, and—through formal shunning—taken away. Rival houses compete for influence, and leaders must balance tradition with the practical needs of governing an empire.",
          "Everyday customs emphasize endurance and shared risk, from courage-testing ceremonies to highly theatrical weddings. Food and drink often signal toughness and authenticity, and remembrance of the dead is treated as an obligation owed to the living reputation of a house."
